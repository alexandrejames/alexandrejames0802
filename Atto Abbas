==Early Life==
Atto Abbas  had never seen a football until the age of 8 when during a stupor he wandered onto a football field, only for a loose ball to hit his tailbone and loop into the goal.

As a youngster atto learnt that the typical characteristics of footballers such as speed, skill and basic motor skills did apply to him, and if he just stood ten yards from goal the ball tended to bounce in off him.

Born in Kaduna on July 4, 1998, he is a Nigerian footballer who plays for Kasımpaşa SK. Atto started his football career at S.M.C Youth before joining the Reserve Team in Kasimpasa.
